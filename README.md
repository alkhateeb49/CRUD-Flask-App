# CRUD-Flask-App
Flask SQLite
Flask can make use of the SQLite3 module of the python to create the database web applications. In this section of the tutorial, we will create a CRUD (create - read - update - delete) application.

Since we have given a detailed overview of how a python application can interact with the SQLite database, to revise the concept, please visit the link: Python SQLite.

CRUD Application in flask
Here, we will manage the employee information in the SQLite database using a flask script to which the admin can interact. For this purpose, database employee.db contains the related tables whereas the table Employees contains information about the employees.

First, let us create a database employee.DB and the table Employees in SQLite using the following python script.
